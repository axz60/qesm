# Quantum Enhanced Spectral Moments (qesm)

A Python package for direct and recursive quantum algorithms to compute **spectral moments**, **density matrices**, and other quantum observables using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/), [PySCF](https://pyscf.org/), [Vayesta] (https://github.com/BoothGroup/Vayesta) and [DYSON] (https://github.com/BoothGroup/dyson). Includes utilities for **quantum chemistry**, **quantum simulation**, and tools for benchmarking with FCI and other classical methods.

## Features

- **Direct and recursive spectral moments calculations**
- **Qiskit-Aer integration**: VQE, expectation values, Hadamard tests
- **PySCF & Vayesta integration**: quantum chemistry and lattice models
- Utilities for Galitskii-Migdal energy, double occupation, and spectral functions
- Well-structured, extensible, and tested.
